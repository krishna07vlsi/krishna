Open Source Versus Commercial Licenses for the gSOAP Software
-------------------------------------------------------------
Copyright(C) 2000-2012, Robert van Engelen, Genivia Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The gSOAP 2.7.x and 2.8.x releases are distributed under:

1. GPL v2 (GNU Public License 2.0):
    If you use gSOAP under the GPL v2 to integrate parts of it or code
    generated by it with your own code, then you are allowed to sell
    copies of the modified program commercially, but only under the terms
    of the GNU GPL v2. Thus, you must make the source code of your programs
    available to the users of your program as described in the GPL, and they
    must be allowed to redistribute and modify it as described in the GPL.
    These requirements are the condition for including the GPL-covered code
    you received in a program of your own.

    For more information on the GNU Public License 2.0, please visit:
        https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html

    Please check the suitability of GPL v2 for your project. Requirements
    imposed by the GPL v2 may affect the release of your software, as
    explained further below in "gSOAP and the GPL".

    If you do not wish to use gSOAP under the GPL v2, then we recommend to
    obtain a commercial license for the commercial edition of gSOAP
    available for purchase from Genivia Inc.

2.  A standard edition commercial-use license can be purchased for commercial
    product development. This license does not impose the GPL v2 open source
    licensing terms, conditions, and limitations. Also an enterprise license
    is available for purchase.

3. Some older parts of the software are also covered by the gSOAP Public
    License 1.3 (which is based on the Mozilla public license 1.1). Please be
    aware that the following software components are NOT covered by this
    older gSOAP Public License and requires a commercial license or are GPL v2
    open source by default:
    - the wsdl2h tool and its source code output,
    - the soapcpp2 tool and its source code output,
    - UDDI code,
    - the webserver example code in gsoap/samples/webserver,
    - and several example applications in the gsoap/samples directory.

gSOAP and the GPL
-----------------

If you use gSOAP under the GPL v2 to integrate parts of it or code generated by
it with your own code, then you are allowed to sell copies of the modified
program commercially, but only under the terms of the GNU GPL v2. Thus, for
instance, you must make the source code available to the users of the program
as described in the GPL, and they must be allowed to redistribute and modify
it as described in the GPL. These requirements are the condition for including
the GPL-covered code you received in a program of your own. These restrictions
may hamper certain proprietary software development scenarios. If you do not
wish for your program to be released under a GPL-compatible open source license,
then an alternate proprietary software license for gSOAP which will remove the
aforementioned requirement is available from Genivia Inc.

The gSOAP software does not include any third-party GPL code. All software was
build from the ground up. Note that the GNU Bison and Flex tools are used to
generate source code for the gSOAP soapcpp2 compiler. However, the
Bison/Flex-generated source code is not restricted by the GPL or LGPL terms.

Non-GPL third-party contributions are included in the 'extras' directory in
the package and you are free to use these contributions. Suggested changes
and improvements by vendors were accepted under the public gSOAP license
(not GPL), which includes support for VxWorks and Apache and IIS modules for
gSOAP.
